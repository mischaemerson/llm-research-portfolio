# Mischa Emerson â€” LLM Research Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my applied AI research engineering portfolio. This repository contains my growing body of hands-on work focused on Large Language Model (LLM) systems, covering:

- âœ… LLM fine-tuning and parameter-efficient training (LoRA, PEFT)
- âœ… Data preparation and cleaning for model training
- âœ… Evaluation frameworks for LLM output quality (BLEU, ROUGE, Exact Match)
- âœ… Responsible AI benchmarking (toxicity, bias, safety)
- âœ… Distributed multi-GPU training experiments (Accelerate, DDP)
- âœ… Efficient inference serving (FastAPI API deployment)
- âœ… RLHF simulation framework (Phase 7)
- âœ… Prompt engineering & reasoning experiments (Phase 8)
- âœ… Live deployment prep (Phase 9 Hyperpolish)
