# Mischa Emerson - LLM Research Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my applied AI research engineering portfolio. This repository contains my growing body of work focused on Large Language Model (LLM) systems, covering:

- LLM fine-tuning and parameter-efficient training
- Data preparation and cleaning for model training
- Evaluation frameworks for LLM output quality
- Responsible AI benchmarking (toxicity, bias, safety)
- Distributed model training experiments
- Efficient inference serving
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
- Prompt engineering and reasoning experiments
