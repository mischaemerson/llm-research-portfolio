# Contributing to Mischa's LLM Research Portfolio

Thank you for your interest in contributing! While this is primarily my personal learning and development repository, I'm open to constructive suggestions, discussions, and small collaborative experiments.

## Ground Rules

- All code must be properly documented and reproducible.
- All results should include clear explanation of model versions, datasets, and evaluation methods used.
- Responsible AI practices are important — please flag any safety, bias, or ethical considerations.

## Collaboration Opportunities

- Dataset cleaning scripts
- Evaluation benchmarks
- Responsible AI measurement tools
- Inference serving optimization
- Experiment reproducibility templates

## Disclaimer

This repository reflects personal learning and experimentation. It is not intended for production or commercial use.

Let's build and learn together!
